`recite` intends to make releasing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)-based libraries easier and avoid missing important steps (e.g. adapting the changelog (because [you should keep one](https://keepachangelog.com/))).

```console
$ recite release patch

recite > ðŸ‘€ Checking everything to make sure you are ready to release ðŸ‘€
recite > 1: âœ“ Make sure you have a (non-empty) pyproject.toml
recite > 2: âœ“ Make sure you're on main/master branch
recite > 3: âœ“ Make sure git is clean
recite > 4: âœ“ Run test-suite
recite > 5: âœ“ Make sure changelog was updated
recite > ðŸ¤“ Everything looks perfect! ðŸ¤“
recite > I will perform the following steps:
recite >        * Would bump version from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
recite >        * Commit version bump
recite >        * Create git tag 0.1.1
recite >        * Push git tag 0.1.1
recite >        * Remind you to upload build as github release
Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
recite > âœ¨ Performing release âœ¨
recite > 1: âœ“ Bump version
recite >        * Bumped version from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
recite > 2: âœ“ Commit version bump
recite > 3: âœ“ Create git tag 0.1.1
recite > 4: âœ“ Push git tag 0.1.1
recite > 5: âœ“ Build and publish with poetry
Please create a github release now! Did you do it? [y/N]: y
recite > 6: âœ“ Remind you to upload build as github release
recite > ðŸš€ Congrats to your release! ðŸš€
```

# Installation

Since `recite` is a python application it is recommended to install it via [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):
```console
$ pipx install recite
```

But you can also install it via pip:

```console
$ pip install recite
```

# Usage

You can perform e.g a patch release with the command:

```console
$ recite release patch
```

The classifiers are the same as poetry's bump rules of the it's [version command](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#version).

To list the available checks use:

```console
$ recite list-checks
```

You can find more info in the [docs](https://recite.readthedocs.io)

# Why?

Previously I used a github action to automatically build and publish a new version of a library if a new tag was pushed. However, sometimes I forgot something crucial (e.g. to adapt the changelog). In this case I had to rush to stop the github action before it would publish the release to pypi (where it would lie forever unable to be rectified).
With `recite` it is ensured all the necessary checks are in place before any tags are created.
