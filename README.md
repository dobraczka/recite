`recite` intends to make releasing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)-based libraries easier and avoid missing important steps (e.g. adapting the changelog (because [you should keep one](https://keepachangelog.com/))).

```console
$ recite patch

recite > ðŸ‘€ Checking everything to make sure you are ready to release ðŸ‘€
recite > 1: âœ“ Make sure you have a (non-empty) pyproject.toml
recite > 2: âœ“ Make sure you're on main/master branch
recite > 3: âœ“ Make sure git is clean
recite > 4: âœ“ Run test-suite
recite > 5: âœ“ Make sure changelog was updated
recite > ðŸ¤“ Everything looks perfect! ðŸ¤“
recite > I will perform the following steps:
recite >        * Would bump version from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
recite >        * Commit version bump
recite >        * Create git tag 0.1.1
recite >        * Push git tag 0.1.1
recite >        * Remind you to upload build as github release
Do you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
recite > âœ¨ Performing release âœ¨
recite > 1: âœ“ Bump version
recite >        * Bumped version from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1
recite > 2: âœ“ Commit version bump
recite > 3: âœ“ Create git tag 0.1.1
recite > 4: âœ“ Push git tag 0.1.1
recite > 5: âœ“ Build and publish with poetry
Please create a github release now! Did you do it? [y/N]: y
recite > 6: âœ“ Remind you to upload build as github release
recite > ðŸš€ Congrats to your release! ðŸš€
```

# Installation

```console
$ pip install recite
```

# Why?

Previously I used a github action to automatically build and publish a new version of a library if a new tag was pushed. However, sometimes I forgot to something crucial (e.g. to adapt the changelog). In this case I had to rush to stop the github action before it would publish the release to pypi (where it would lie forever unable to be rectified).
This ensures all the necessary checks are in place before any tags are created.
